### **User Experience (UX)**

#### **First Time Visitor Goals:**

a) As a first time visitor I would like to get to grips with and comprehend instantly the purpose and intent of the website. This should be communicated clearly

b) I should be able to search for specific games using a search bar feature as well as have the option to view all games by genre

c) I should be able to see the posts of other users with a feature to identify these users. 

d) I should be able to register an account where I can interact with the sites community via the comment sections of games as well as be able to create a wishlist for all the games I am interested in purchasing in the future. 

#### **Returning Visitor Goals:**
a) As a returning user I would like to be able to manage my account that I have set up when first interacting with the site. There should be no way for an individual to brute force their way into my account.

b) I should also be able to uplad games to the site for the communities benefit where other members can leave their own opiions on and add to their own wishlist if they desire so. Any games, and subsequent comments for the game, that have been uploaded to the GameChat website should only be deletable by an admin of the site and the user who has uploaded said game. 

c) I should be able to manage the games on my wishlist with ease and be able to sort the wishlist by genre as well as alphabetically. 


#### **Site Owner Goals:** 
a) As the site owner I should have full admin capabitlites being able to monitor and update anything I would like to on the webiste. This includes users, games posted and genres of games on the website. 

### Design

#### Colour Scheme
* The colour scheme for my website is a primary colour of red, secondary colour of black in the form of the background and a tertiary colour of white in the form of all scripture on the site. I feel the scheme chosen reflects what I would like the user to feel when on the site and that is relaxed and comfortable. This comfort comes from the dark tones of the site which is less straining to the eyes than more conventional light tones but still retains an aesthetically pleasing design.

#### Typography
* In terms of typography the fonts Monoton and Roboto. The Monoton font was chosen due to the fact that it has a very retro connotation and is a reminder to the user of the games and tech of the past. This is coupled with the Roboto font that is very sleek and modern to connote the ever changing and devloping games coming out now and in the coming future. These two fonts complement each other even though there symbolism run parallel and that's why I was very much happy to choose this pairing.
